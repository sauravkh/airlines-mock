					<h4> "did not get sleep at all" </h4>

						<span>✅ <a href="#">Trip Verified</a> | Asheville to Bonaire via Atlanta. I am writing only because of the appalling customer service I recently received. I know the flights are full and tensions are high however Delta puts it head and the ground and ignores it. We were on a flight from Asheville to Bonaire via Atlanta. The flight from Asheville had a small mechanical problem. It took the mechanic less than a minute to fix, however it took the mechanic 1.5 hours to get to the airport. Really? So we, four of us, missed our flight to Bonaire. This was at 9am and we are in Atlanta now for a full 24 hours - they would not put us on another flight. We go to the customer service desk and give us voucher to a motel that their employees do not even stay in. We asked for another option, with a restaurant and they said they do not give hotel vouchers to hotels with restaurants. No food vouchers, no transportation, nothing. We asked to talk to a manager and they gave us a number that is only answered Monday through Friday 9 to 5pm. It is a Saturday and we are flying out of the country. We have a water front condo with two bedrooms and a car rental that we lost out on. The next day we have to check our bags in all over again. My husband and I wait in line to check our bags in. We had picked them up the day before so we could have our things. After 25 minutes to do this, we are told we have to go into another line b/c there is no record we had paid for a bag the day before to Bonaire. There was another 20 to 30 minute line. I asked if she could take us to the front of the line and she said no. My husband nearly had a melt down. He gave me the dressing down and she felt so badly she took us over and checked us in. NOW WHY COULD SHE NOT DO THAT TO BEGIN WITH. I felt like they were trying to make us late and we would miss our flight again.</span>

					<h4> "rude and short with me" </h4>

					<br>
					<div>
						<span>✅ <a href="#">Trip Verified</a> | This is the last time I’m flying with Delta. I’ve always supported this airline, I have for years, but from now on I’m taking my business elsewhere. Completely unhelpful, every single employee was rude and short with me. Not only with me but with everyone else as well. Flying out of Orlando can be hard I understand that but that’s no excuse to treat people disrespectfully. Also everyone on the plane is paying an arm and a leg to where they need to be.</span>

					<h4> "enjoyed the flight experience" </h4>
					<span> Kefu Cai (New Zealand) 23rd July 2019</span>
					<br>
					<div>
						<span>Not Verified | Auckland to Istanbul via Dubai. Despite the lengthy flying hours I enjoyed the flight experience partly due to A380's ambience and quietness, but mostly due to the comfort of the seat, legroom and great in-flight food experience. The flight attendants were generous to give out snacks/drinks throughout which really helped. Having Wifi was revolutionary that ability of being able to connect to friends/family is great! Having dual IFE screen on the IFE looked fancy but in the end it wasn't that interesting. The contents of ICE didn't live up to its hype to be honest. From the air to the ground the staff did a stellar job looking after not just passengers, but also baggage, such as fragile items like musical instruments.</span>

					<h4> "The seat was so uncomfortable" </h4>
					<span> D Yap (Singapore) 20th July 2019</span>
					<br>
					<div>
						<span>✅ <a href="#">Trip Verified </a>| We flew with Emirates from Edinburgh to Singapore via Dubai. The segment between Edinburgh and Singapore was on a much older B777 wide-body plane. The seats do not lie 180 flat but at an angle. That is my main issue with the flight. The seat was so uncomfortable that I didn't get any sleep. The food was ok. The flight attendant was ok but lacking warmth. For instance, when I boarded the flight I handed over my jacket asking politely "would you mind hanging this up for me" to one of the flight attendants but was replied rather coldly that she would come back to me later. I understand that boarding is one of the busiest times for them but she was just not that friendly when she responded as if I was making an outrageous demand. However, the service in the second segment was better. Their A380-800 has an older fit-out and the stainless steel handrails make it really outdated but at least the seat lay flat 180 degrees and I managed to have a couple of hours sleep. The transit at Dubai airport was not a nice experience, the lounge is outdated and it was so crowded. It felt like being a cattle market. I wouldn't choose to fly with them on this route again especially the middle stop over actually breaks up the trip in half and you can not get a good long hours sleep.</span>

The next sector ek001 Dubai to London no cabin crew walking, all disappear after the service. Glasgow to Dubai on an old A380, IFE there is a crack line, service attendant was good but when leaving plane the hand baggage door above our seat unable to open, cabin crew assisted us in opening the door. Very helpful staff on Ek028, from Dubai to Singapore unfriendly service, rude people not so friendly, never walk around with drinks after food service, just couldn't be bordered.

					<h4> "luxury low-cost carrier" </h4>
					<span>P Lloyd (Thailand) 13th July 2019</span>
					<br>
					<div>
						<span>✅ <a href="#">Trip Verified </a>Bangkok to Istanbul via Dubai. I never liked Emirates, but due to last minute booking, Emirates was only available. All my fears came true. BKK - DXB: It was an overnight flight, so not much service required. Still, my monitor did not work, instead of rebooting it, I was offered to relocate myself. I did not want to do this; nothing happened with my monitor in 6.45 hours. Not a big issue, but shows the interest of the crew in real customer service. The crew was the most unpassionate and unpolite I saw in the last year. I look out for details and me even the uniforms were worn without proud and just looked untidy. It seemed like they were just angry and unhappy with their employer and shortsighted they make their passenger pay it. DXB lounge: just not up to a standard for a 3,000 USD ticket. Food average, furniture is worn out, staff unfriendly. DXB - IST: at last, the crew was friendly, and this was a good flight experience. Overall for Emirates became a luxury low-cost carrier, with overpricing in the high-end market. Economy class for sure is well worth the money you pay</span>

					<h4> "Emirates should really rethink boarding times" </h4>
					<span>Ameer Nusairat (Kuwait) 8th July 2019</span>
					<br>
					<div>
						<span>✅ <a href="#">Trip Verified </a> Kuwait to Amman via Dubai on 3rd July 2019. If you ever depart from Kuwait and are flying Emirates, I’d strongly suggest using online check-in. At KWI, Emirates has a separate counter for online check-in passengers thus enabling passengers to skip the queue and proceed directly to the counter without having to wait. Be aware that during online check-in, you will not receive e-boarding passes if departing from Kuwait. I contacted Emirates and was told this is not an issue. At the counter, I received the boarding passes for both flights EK 856 (KWI-DXB) and my connecting flight EK 903 (DXB-AMM). The check-in experience was smooth, and within 10 minutes, I was through to immigration and security. Online check-in if departing from Kuwait is a lifesaver! First leg EK 856 from Kuwait to Dubai on the B777-300 ER. Boarding began 45 minutes prior to departure. It was chaotic as expected for a fully-booked flight. Unfortunately, the aircraft was really old (registration A6-EBE). The screen was very small and ICE version was also very old. 3-4-3 configuration is not a favorite, and the seats felt narrow. Only 1 meal choice and no menus were given. Aircraft was 30 minutes late departing Kuwait due to late completion of boarding. Luckily, arrival in Dubai was only 5 minutes late despite the 30 minute delay departing Kuwait. If possible, book a seat on the left or right side of the aircraft (rows A, B, C or H, J, K). These seats will feel less cramped than seats in the middle (rows D, E, F, G). I was seated in seat 33A. Overall, a good flight although I’d avoid the EK B777 economy product all-together (unfortunately EK doesn’t fly the A380 to Kuwait so that’s not possible). Second leg EK 903 from Dubai to Amman on the A380-800. First time flying the EK A380! Again, boarding began 45 minutes prior to departure. The aircraft was definitely newer (registration A6-EOU). ICE version was newer and screen was much bigger. Still a 3-4-3 configuration however much more comfortable than the 777. Just like the previous flight, no menus were given and there was only 1 meal choice. Aircraft was 30 minutes late departing Dubai and arrival in Amman was only 3 minutes late. I was seated in seat 78K. Baggage claim at AMM was abysmal! I wonder if the problem lies with Emirates or the baggage handling system at AMM. I can’t really give them much blame due to the fact that the aircraft was an A380, but waiting 1 hour and 15 minutes for baggage delivery is still unacceptable! Also, in my opinion, Emirates should really rethink boarding times. Boarding an aircraft 45 minutes prior to scheduled departure time surely guarantees a delay. On EK 856, pushback was not until 15 minutes after scheduled departure time and on EK 903, pushback was not until 13 minutes after scheduled departure time! In my opinion, boarding should begin 60 minutes prior to scheduled departure time. Also, Emirates should grant its aircraft a 2-hour turn-around time slot. This would give 1 hour to clean and prep the aircraft for boarding and an additional hour to complete boarding, ensuring an on-time departure.</span>

					<h4> "Pay for the excess baggage $100" </h4>
					<span>Manoj Somanathan (Canada) 5th July 2019</span>
					<br>
					<div>
						<span>✅ <a href="#">Trip Verified </a> I was travelling from Gatwick to Kochi via Dubai and had a small carry on bag and my back pack. I was allowed 7 Kgs and my bag weighed a little over 7 Kgs. I did not have any problem at Gatwick Airport. I had a connecting flight from Dubai to Kochi. As Dubai airport duty free had some excellent deals and I ended up buying a couple of bottles of liquor and some chocolates. At the boarding gate, the customer service personnel forced me to weigh my carry on bags again and found 4 Kgs extra due to the items that I bought from the airport and asked me to pay for over weight. I was given 3 options: 1. Throw away the items that I bought from the airport (worth USD$200) 2. Return the items back to the store that was 20 minutes away from the gate 3. Pay for the excess baggage $100 I was put in a very tough situation when I was so tired from my previous two flights (8 hours each). I did not have any other choice than paying for the excess baggage. My advise to anyone travelling through Dubai, is to avoid buying any thing from the duty free if you already have 7 Kgs of items in your carry on baggage. They are going to weigh it at the boarding gate and charge you a huge amount that would kill all the savings that you got from your purchases. I will be happy if at least one person is benefited from this feedback.</span>

					<h4> "The worst cabin service" </h4>
					<span>J Meares (Australia) 4th July 2019</span>
					<br>
					<div>
						<span>✅ <a href="#">Trip Verified </a>  Dubai to Manchester. The worst cabin service I have experienced on any airline. At great expense I took the flight from Dubai to Manchester yesterday, excited to be trying a business class seat on the A380. I fly often but I have to say this was the worst cabin crew I have ever experienced on any airline. I feel as if I paid for them to have a great holiday. I know that other passengers felt the same way. We were all SO upset that we talked to each other about it both on the plane and afterwards. From the moment of boarding, there was no usual warm welcome. I was greeted by a very grumpy hostile cabin attendant. When she brought the breakfast menu later she couldn’t answer simple questions about the ingredients. “I can’t say”. “Could you please find out?” “No, the meal is precooked, we can’t tell”. I have never had that response before. The crew stood and sat at the back chatting away having a great time. There were many of them and few passengers. A perfect opportunity to showcase individual, fantastic service. Unfortunately, the head of the cabin crew was at the back chatting with them all – so there was little leadership. After complaints from passengers, nothing changed. On take-off they did not remove our glasses, on landing they did not check that we were strapped in, they did not remove our cups and glasses once again. I choked on my breakfast and tried to call for help. I waved and pressed the service button. No one came. I managed to scramble out of my seat, balance my tray on the side and get to the bathroom where I vomited. The food was appalling, dry and over cooked. My tea was served cold. The attendant was so grumpy, rude and unhelpful that I actually asked her whether she’d had bad news from home. She said “I am tired!” I paid thousands of very hard-earned money for this flight – it is not the passengers’ job to do the work of the tired, disgruntled crew! They kept one toilet locked. They did not walk through the cabin to see if the passengers were ok. They did not help the mother with her 3 year old across the aisle from me. Airlines need to understand – we passengers no longer want glamour, lipstick, tight skirts and high heels – we want professional, great service from intelligent crew - happy to be in their highly sought-after jobs!</span>
