                            <span>  Trip Verified |  Dubai to Hong Kong. Want to be robbed in business class? Then let me recommend Cathay Pacific. Apparently this happens enough that showing people kindness and compassion does not matter to crew members as demonstrated to me when my purse was stolen from the business class bin where the flight attendant put it and found in the economy toilet during my night flight from Dubai to Hong Kong. After I exited the plane and the police conducted the investigation that did not recover the lost items, no crew member offered their apologies or help. Not one offered to help me find the lounge or my connecting flight. No one asked me where I was going or if I needed anything. In tears I asked security personnel for help. She asked a Cathay employee to take me to the lounge. The employee looked less than thrilled and put upon. She walked several strides ahead of me as I struggled to keep up. I'd trade a fancy lounge for safety, kindness and an apology any day.</span>

However, this is the 2nd time I flew with Cathay Pacific and both times were delayed screwed up my hotel reservations and plans for work. I purchased the higher price so that I don't have to have a long layover but end up staying 12 hrs. My original ticket depart from CEB-HKG and then HKG-LAX and I was supposed to arrived July 3rd 10pm. My flight from Cebu to HKG got delayed for half an hour but I only have 55 mins layover in HK. The moment I arrived in HKG, I was told my flight is reschedule (I expected it) the airline did provide me a hotel to stay at including free breakfast. My new ticket departs July 4th and my arrival in LAX is July 4th. I'm just upset that I purchased the expensive ticket and my flight still got delayed. I get it delays and stuff comes up but come on.  This is the 2nd time that happened to me. Same 12 hrs of layover and I had to cancel my hotel and couldn't get my refund. </span>

                            <span>  Trip Verified |  My first experience on Cathay Pacific was horrific. I waited in line for 2 hours at JFK to board flight 841 to Hong Kong (with a connection to Koh Samui) that was scheduled to leave at 10am on Wednesday June 26th while the gate attendant kept saying there was a minor technical delay and we would be boarding in a few minutes. After two hours the desk attendant said while the flight was not cancelled we had to all leave the gate immediately and pick up our luggage. I called to reschedule my flight but was told I could not do so because I was already checked in for fight 841 and had to go to the service desk. After waiting another hour for my luggage I went to the business class service window where I had a three hour wait to be helped. There was pandemonium at the window with hordes of people crowding the counter and the agents ignoring the lines. After waiting for hours and finally getting an agent to help me I was told that I was already rebooked on flight 845 which was leaving at 1am the following morning. I had not received an email or text about this and it appears I waited in line for hours for no reason. When I showed up for flight 845 at 10pm that night after losing a day of my life waiting at JFK I was told it was overbooked and they did not have a seat for me. I was trying to connect to a flight to Koh Samui where I had reservations at a resort. In the end I was booked on a flight that went to Vancouver and then on to Hong Kong which added five hours to my flying time. I missed an entire day at the resort where I was headed. And the worse of it all is that there was no communication from the airline.I paid $10,000 for this business class ticket and spent the money hoping that by going business class I would not be subjected to so much stress. I am a frequent flyer on Delta and American Airlines and although they have their problems I have never experienced anything like this before in terms of the lack of communication, misinformation, pandemonium at the check-in desk, customer service that said it could not help me because I was checked into a flight that never took off, being rebooked onto a flight that had no capacity and lack of any apparent management oversight. In the end the airline has offered my a $250 voucher toward a future flight which feels inadequate. I am really disappointed in an airline that I though was among the best in the world.</span>

                            <span>  Trip Verified |  Hong Kong to Cairns. Very poor premium economy service. This was the worst inflight service I've ever experienced. Took two hours for food to arrive on a relatively short 6.5 hour overnight flight. When it did arrive it was abysmal. Very small portion, bland, and overly salty tomato sauce on dried pasta. Not even three course meal. Crew very inefficient, passengers still had meal trays waiting collection three hours after take out. Then we were woken up again two hours later for "breakfast" which was a dry pastry in a box. This was my third trip on Cathay on this same route, and their inflight service has been very poor indeed each time. They are not cheap, and I would not want to fly again with them. Their seats are very comfortable but the rest falls far behind their competitors.</span>

Johannesburg to Hong Kong, Boeing 777-300 ER. It was my first international flight to Asia especially, Hong Kong. The cabin crew was the friendliest and the service on board was amazing. Fortunately for me, I had no other passengers seated next to me and it was so comfortable and relaxing throughout my longest flight ever. The only down factor was that it was very cold throughout the night. My feet were very cold because of the air conditioner and of course flying over oceans too. I loved the fact that the flight attendant handed passengers disembarking from the airline for Hong Kong special visitor slips. I think it was really handy and going through immigration went quite fast. Thank you to Cathay Pacific flight CX 749 back to OR Tambo International Aiport from Hong Kong on the 16th June for giving me a last-minute seat onboard this flight because I missed my actual flight on the 15th June 2019 back to South Africa. Cathay Pacific flight CX 749 was really comfortable and much warmer on board and the service was good but can be improved. I will definitely fly again with Cathay Pacific in the future.</span>

                            <span>  Trip Verified | This is an interesting 5th freedom flight operated by Cathay Pacific, with the aircraft continuing onto Hong Kong from Bangkok. My first time flying an A350 and I was amazed by the spaciousness of the cabin. Leg room was comfortably sufficient for economy class and the load factor was relatively low so I had the row to myself which is a plus point. Food was above average and quite a spread - Main course, fruits, bread, water, drinks, ice cream. Cabin crew were largely courteous and smiley, except for one who kept a poker face for most of the time. Departed and landed on time.</span>

                            <span>  Trip Verified | Sydney to Dubai via Hong Kong. At my Sydney bag drop, I was fortunate to be advised at check-in by the most engaging, informative supervisor. Time was taken to explain my seating. advice re: my HK layover etc. Her kindness was appreciated. Sadly that was the end of any memorable Cathay experience. It was a full flight on an ancient aircraft which might have been doable except for the inconsistency with the cabin crew. I found any interaction with some was most unpleasant. Others were helpful but few. After seeing the menu I was waiting for refreshments to arrive. I watched the trolley loaded in the galley and was totally ignored. I was surprised and with the attitude of the female crew member in my area hesitant to ask. As this woman was abrupt, dismissive, actually bordering on rude. Therefore I left the flight certainly looking for some refreshment. These flights are not budget and the disdain I experienced was awful. The HK to Dubai was better as it was a night flight but breakfast was very ordinary. After my return home, this will be my last Cathay flight. I dread if anything goes wrong based on their attitude when all was on schedule.</span>

                            <span>  Trip Verified |  Boston to Jakarta via Hong Kong. A missed connection on American Airlines bumped me to Cathay Pacific. The 15 hour flight to Hong Kong was ok. The food was average, the flight staff were nice. My problem came when they refused to even considering to allow me to fly standby on a flight that was 9 hours earlier because locating my baggage with a 5 hour window was going to be too much trouble. I even offered to retrieve the bags the next day since 1 of them appeared to be left in Boston anyway. The customer service was terrible and they just keep reminding me it was American Airlines that caused me to miss the original flight not them so they were not obligated to help me. C.H. an unfriendly girl at the service desk was particularly indifferent and unapologetic. She suggested that she couldn’t help me because she didn’t know how much I paid for my original ticket. I was 38 hours into this nightmare and she had no problem adding another 10 hours to my trip because I originally booked with a partner airline. Whatever this One World partnership is they should boot Cathay out of their system for terrible customer service.</span>

                            <span>  Trip Verified |  Travelled Ho Chi Minh City to Dubai via Hong Kong on 29 June 2019 on B777-300 and B330-300 respectively. Smooth check-in with 3 business class counters open. My luggage got checked in to the next 4 legs (including on another ticket with Kenya Airways). Nice. Priority lane for security and lounge in Le Saigonnais (was given 2 choices) were fine. First flight delayed from SGN. An early announced 1 hour delay ended up to be 2 hours made me miss my HKG-connection by 2 hours. That caused me to miss my connection in HKG where staff waited for me tried to rebook and examined a lot of option. Next CX flight to DXB kicked off only 10 hours later and made me lose my onward tickets (2 legs). A lot of courtesy, assistance, and sympathy was received in HKG due to the delay but the results and outcome eventually became nil as they regretted early promised options of sending me onwards via Jo-burg or with Emirates to Dubai. Suffered many hours in desperation trying to sort out my further connections from their Bridge Lounge. First flight world  class cuisine and caring. Business class full.  Second flight so, so – dinner hardly edible. Both flights: FAs are active, caring, and truly professional. Beer choices are a disaster and limited to mass produced industrial stuff (Heineken, Carlsberg, Foster, and San Miguel). No WiFi; good IFE. Clean aircraft. Good lounges in HKG. Delay unacceptable and delay handling unsatisfactory: was denied to see the manager as the staff would not allow. They pay lipservice, a lot of lipservice, but significant results, actions, or willingness to pay for any additional routing are not to be seen. They let down passengers by eventually being stingy: nothing must cost them anything additional. Not a true business class experience. The airline falls behind what I expected. Wonder how they treat economy class passengers during irregularities? I can mention 10 airlines that supersede CX with a better biz-class product. It seems at least that they had a bad day.</span>

Though the gate was a bit far away from the immigration, the check in counter was very quick. The seat was modern and they provided a wide range of movies and TV shows in the IFE system. Two meals were served and snacks including cup noodles were served in between. Desserts were also served in the economy class. I could get my check in luggage swiftly and reached central London in an hour.</span>
